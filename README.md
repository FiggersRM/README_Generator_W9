# README_Generator_W9

## Description

In this week, we were tasked with using node to create a readME file after taking in user input. We were given starter code that included a node.js file, a package.json file, and a utils folder containing a generateMarkdown.js file. We were then tasked with using inquirer to take in user input to fill out a readME, which would then be created using the generateMarkdown file. To start, run node index in the terminal to be prompted about what goes into the README. After taking the user input, the markdown file is created under the name createdREADME.md.

## Installation

Uses the inquirer node package

## Usage

This application can be used to create a README for your own project. To run it, use node index in the terminal.
